                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">Before being named Johnson & Johnson's Chief Human Resources Officer in 2010, Peter Fasolo had worked in Europe at Bristol-Meyers Squibb, had been the head of human resources at a unit of Johnson & Johnson, and had served as chief talent officer for private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. No surprise, then, that Fasolo is a strong supporter of the importance of cross-sector, global experience among Johnson & Johnson's approximately 126,000 employees. To validate this perspective on varied employee experience, Fasolo turned to data analytics. We sat down with Fasolo, who is a rare combination of deliberate, precise, and warm, in his corner suite at J&J’s New Brunswick, N.J. offices to speak about innovation and leadership, and how data helps Johnson & Johnson foster both.</p>

                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">What kind of talent are you looking for at Johnson & Johnson and how do you go about finding it?</h4>
                                        <p>At most major corporations, the head of HR has to be an extremely strong strategic adviser to the CEO, the board, and the top team. That means not just filling the leadership positions with the current needs of the organization, but being able to look out three or five years, and in some cases even beyond that, in terms of the new capabilities that large companies need to compete in the future. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>And like many companies, we're dependent on innovation. We are constantly asking ourselves, "Do we have the scientific and innovation capabilities to compete?" We are looking at what we need to build internally, and how we ensure we have a network of external innovation out in the marketplace.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>If we were sitting across from each other 10 or 15 years ago, I may have laid out a system inside Johnson & Johnson where world-class scientists and academics were coming into industry, and would stay here throughout a career and manage their way to breakthrough therapies. It's very different today. We focus on the greatest unmet medical needs. Oncology, for example. Or HIV/AIDS, or Immunology. And then we are open to where the ideas come from. We have innovation centers that work with outside networks in academia, in small startups, at biotechs.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">We have an internal venture capital group that's making bets on early-stage companies. We look at areas of unmet medical need, and then we see where the science brings us, as opposed to doing everything on the inside. We're constantly pursuing science, no matter where it's emerging.</p>

                                </div>

                

                                    <div class="ibm-col-6-4 ibm-center-block ibm-col-medium-1-1">
                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">Sounds pretty wide open. How do you know you’re doing a good job of it? </h4>
                                        <p>In order for human resources to do fundamental strategic work on behalf of the firm, we have to demonstrate that what we are advocating makes a difference. We hire close to 20,000 associates around the globe every year. We move roughly 1,200 to 1,500 global assignees. We hire thousands of college recruits and MBAs. What are we getting for that? And how do we serve them best, to get a return on that?</p>
                                        
                                    
                                        <p>In order to answer some of these questions, we started building out an analytics group about three or four years ago. And we’ve learned a lot.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>For example, we noticed that there was a belief that getting an experienced hire was better than a recent graduate from our college recruiting program. And so our college recruiting started to dip, and our hiring of more experienced people was going up. We stepped back and said, "Is that the right trend?" With analytics, we were able to tell that, in the first year or so, the managers' assumptions were right. With experienced hires, they were getting some higher productivity in the very beginning. But when you compared the experienced hires with the college recruits, those lines crossed after two years. And then your college recruits started producing more, their performance was higher, their retention rates were greater, and their promotability was higher.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">So with that, we made policy changes. And we explained to managers that if we disinvested in the college recruiting, they'd get a short-term fix from the experienced hires, but in the long run, we'd put the company at a disadvantage.</p>

                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">Has data like this changed the way people manage at J&J?</h4>
                                        <p>I'm always talking about the importance of cross-sector experience, and of global experience. Anyone could easily challenge me and say, "Well, how do you know your philosophy is right, Peter?" Our analytics group helped us understand that cross-sector, global assignments created more diverse, more malleable and more promotable leaders over time. We learned that when someone moved across sectors, or across functions, they were 45 percent more likely to get promoted.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Our analytics group also looked at the self-assessments as part of our annual performance reviews. People obviously strongly advocate their position during self-assessments. We found there is very little correlation between the self-assessment and the actual outcomes of the performance review and the person's promotability. So we got self-assessments out of the system during mid-year reviews. </p>
                                        
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">Another example is that every year we look at our high-flyers and our very high-potential people, to see if we're paying them in a differentiated way and retaining them. We found that every time that we do special off-cycle equity grants or off-cycle retention grants, we can in fact correlate those with higher retention rates for our-high flyers. </p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">Are these findings based on internal data, or do you use external data sets as well? </h4>
                                        
                                        <p>We sit on internal data sets for talent, for promotion rates, and diversity. Externally, we benchmark ourselves. We think we're doing very well on engagement and we look at year-over-year comparisons internally, but we also benchmark ourselves against something that's called the Mayflower norm. Mayflower Group includes companies of our ilk and our globality, and we compare ourselves to each other blindly and confidentially. </p>
                                        
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">I also know that we have one of the healthiest workforces on the planet because I look at how our costs compare to the healthcare cost index, but I also compare our numbers to those from the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC tracks smoking rates, obesity rates, triglyceride rates, diabetes rates. We are better than the norms. </p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">In your search for strong leaders, what criteria do you use? </h4>
                                        <p>Leaders that are more successful than others share a lot of common experiences and characteristics. The first thing is, they are not perfect. But they have learned from their mistakes. When you talk with them and see the fingerprints that they leave in the organization, they attribute their successes and their failures to learning. They don't try to explain it away to a set of circumstances. The second thing we find is that they surround themselves with people who in many respects are better than they are individually. So they have teams around them that are globally diverse, ethnically diverse, gender diverse and they are gifted at getting solutions out of the teams that are better than any one individual.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">We see it through [our employee surveys], we see it by the teams that they surround themselves with, and we look at their business performance. We've been able to demonstrate that those leaders at J&J who have higher scores in innovation and strategy, also have higher business unit performance, and have leadership teams that are more diverse. </p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">What have you learned about data analytics for HR that other companies can learn from? </h4>
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">You have to get really smart in knowing what questions to ask. We continue to learn our way through that. You can get trapped in a lot of activity-based measures. So, for example, in recruiting, you can measure things like cost to hire, time to fill, quality of hire, etc. Those are important, but I would argue those are activity-based measures.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4 class="ibm-h3 ibm-bold">What's wrong with those sorts of metrics?</h4>
                                        <p>Nothing. But ultimately, you could be very good at activity measures and still miss the outcome you're trying to achieve.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In recruiting, for example, I'm not just interested in whether you had a diverse slate of candidates. I want to know what your selection ratio was, and if you actually hired a diverse leader who ended up being extremely successful and increased our bench strength for the corporation. </p>
                                        
                                        <p class="ibm-padding-bottom-r1">So we start with the end in mind, which is, "Do we have the right talent?" And, "Do we have the bench strength to compete in the future?" That's an outcome-driven question. </p>
