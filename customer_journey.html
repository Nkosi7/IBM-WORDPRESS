<p>
<p>Customers interact with a company at multiple physical and digital touch points, forming relationships with a brand through real, personal experiences. They get to know a portfolio of offerings and consider them in context with their own needs when making buying decisions. They integrate products into their daily lives and build routines around their use and sing their praises on social media. Most likely, however, not every customer is doing all of this at the same time.</p>

<p>In fact, individuals are on their own journey with a brand, and where and how a company chooses to meet them along that journey is the key to engaged, loyal customers. While the idea of a customer journey is nothing new, <a href="https://www.think-exchange.com/new-thinking/experience-revolution-game-on">the stakes have never been higher</a>, nor has the ability to gain better understanding of your customers as individuals. Considering <em>how</em> your customer interacts with your product and not just <em>what</em> they encounter along the way involves developing empathy for your buyers as individuals, and applying this understanding in the solutions you offer and service you provide.</p> 

<p>To create experiences that feel integrated and meaningful to customers in spite of ever-shifting technology landscapes, unseen disruptors and a host of other business challenges, it’s important to never lose sight of the customers’ journey. Here's how you can future-proof the marketing methods you use to meet them along their way.

<h2>1. Start and continue a conversation with customers through content.</h2><p>
It may be that someone doesn’t want to buy your product, but what if that someone is just not ready to buy right now? How would you tell the difference, and how can you work to be there when they <em>are </em>ready? “Content becomes the conversation across all [buying] stages,” advises Jon Busman, Program Director, Marketing for IBM Social <a href="https://www.think-exchange.com/events/futureproof-your-customers-journey">during a THINK Leaders webinar</a>.</p>

<p>The right content can provide value on top of a service or product in a way that is entertaining, educational, informative or newsworthy. It provides further insights into how customers are engaging with your brand, helping you to understand where they are in their journey. “I believe that content has switched from being a building block to a foundation in marketing,” says Sandra Zoratti, Content and Partner Chair of The CMO Club. </p>

<h2>2. Beware false choices that position quality experiences against the bottom line.</h2><p>
Buyers know they have more choices than ever, and they will move along if they are unsatisfied. Forward-thinking businesses are implementing a host of creative ways to shape customer experiences, from new mobile apps to wearables, virtual reality and 3D printing. While much of this requires an initial investment in time and resources, returns are big if it leads to attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Focusing on the customer journey helps a company know when to execute on new offerings or business models that improve the experience and gain measurable insights.</p>

<em>From a <a href="https://www.think-exchange.com/new-thinking/experience-revolution-game-on">customer engagement survey</a> asking, "To what extent is your organization implementing the following customer engagement initiatives within the next 12 months?" N=338</em><br>
<p>
<h2>3. Extend your focus—and your budget—across buying stages.</h2>
<p>The customer journey does not end as soon as a purchase is made. Once only the purview of marketing and sales teams, focusing on customer experience is a practice that the entire C-suite can deploy. This means forming partnerships across the boardroom table and perhaps some strategic budget sharing. “We have seen marketers investing by channel traditionally, so this is a very new finding, in terms of where CMOs are actually spending their dollars,” says Zoratti. “A few years ago, about 80 percent was spent on acquisition and now we see a big portion of it moving down the funnel, if you will, toward retention and advocacy.”</p>

<p><h2>4. Think far outside your industry.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.think-exchange.com/how-to/step-by-step-hidden-competition">Competition can come from some pretty unexpected places</a>, and all industries are fair game for disruption. Before Airbnb, hotels worried about competition from other hotels. Now, hotels worldwide are also competing with people willing to open their homes to strangers thanks to one tech start-up. Hospitality is by no means the only industry at risk of unseen competition. According to <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/c-suite/study/" target="_blank">the latest IBM Global C-suite study</a>, industry convergence is top of mind for many executives. Fifty-four percent of business leaders surveyed saw competition coming from outside their industry, an increase of 26 percent from just two years prior. This means leaders should always be looking to learn from far outside their industry to best understand how experimental business models and emerging technology can not just shake up the status quo, but transform it going forward. These have big implications as to how and why a customer might look to your offering, and their preferences for engagement along their journey.</p>

<h2>5. Don’t always look to customers to define their own journey.</h2>
<p>This may seem counter-intuitive, as designing products and experiences focused on your customer is essential. However, your buyers are not the only innovation advocates to turn to, especially if your product is one they already know, love and aren’t necessarily looking to improve. Henry Ford has been credited with saying, “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would’ve said faster horses.” It’s up to business leaders to make difficult choices, not shy away from experimentation and to look for opportunities to shape customer experiences in ways never before imagined.</p>
