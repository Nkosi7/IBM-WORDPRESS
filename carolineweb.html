<p class="intro newsletter-show">Ever wonder why “good days” seem so elusive? The answer lies at the intersection of economics, behavioral science and psychology, a matrixed space few occupy quite so well as Caroline Webb. With characteristic clarity and wit, the Oxford and Cambridge-trained economist shows us how we can put brain science to work in her new book, <i><a href="http://carolinewebb.co/books/how-to-have-a-good-day/" target="_blank">How to Have a Good Day</a></i>. The book unpacks reams of scientific findings to point out how we can apply recent brain research to create more rewarding and productive work lives. </p>

<p>Webb began her career at the Bank of England, where she authored the Bank’s prestigious Inflation Report. Though a technical expert, Webb has always been most inspired by the people and stories behind the numbers. She followed her interest in the human side of data analysis to McKinsey & Company, where she co-founded the firm’s leadership practice, developed a new model for team effectiveness, designed their flagship program to help women become more self-confident and effective business leaders, and served as executive coach to senior leaders worldwide. Webb is now the founder and CEO of Sevenshift, an advisory firm focused on the science and practice of high performance in the workplace. We asked Webb what science tells us about how to improve job effectiveness, whether you are currently a CEO or a junior employee with aspirations to join the C-suite<br> one day.</p>

<p class="question">You write that a good day is one where we “get a buzz from feeling productive and from knowing that [our] efforts counted toward something worthwhile.” Why do so many of us consistently feel we’re so terrible at this?</p>
<p>The way our minds work, just a single incident can leave us feeling like the whole day was awful. It could be a difficult conversation. Maybe we felt like we weren’t being listened to. Maybe urgent things crowded out more important ones and prevented us from finishing what we intended.</p>

<p>But just as small setbacks can cloud our day, it doesn’t take an awful lot to prop up our mood and counteract those negative experiences. Research suggests a few small things can shape our mindset and interactions for the better. We just tend not to pay attention to those small things while we’re hurtling through the day. The message that comes out of my work is that by being a little more deliberate in how we manage ourselves, we can have great working days far more consistently. </p>

<p class="question">Your advice around setting intentions, not letting our attention zig-zag, doing our most challenging thinking tasks when we’re most fresh, and so on feels like common-sense. Are we just tuning it all out or is something else going on?</p>
<p>Ancient knowledge is ancient because it works. But we’re inclined to listen with half an ear to general advice. It’s specific examples and evidence that gets us to change. So there’s been a big win in the last few decades from the advances in behavioral science, because those of us who might have been skeptical now have that hard evidence to motivate us. We know far more, for instance, about how our physical well-being contributes to our on-the-job effectiveness. The way our brain works means that we’re not going to be our most productive or brilliant if we keep our nose to the grindstone all day. Twenty years ago, people might have said, “I kind of know that,” but there was nothing concrete to point to that made it categorical. Now we have solid proof that can be described in layman’s terms—giving us the good reasons we need to shift the way we’re working.</p>

<p class="question">You’re an economist by training, which made me wonder, have you priced the opportunity cost of having a good or bad day? What’s the ROI for an organization to invest in raising the personal professional workplace IQ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup reports</a> that only 13 percent of professionals worldwide feel truly engaged with their work. And the numbers are just as bad for people with high levels of educational attainment. That resonates with my experience working with senior, highly ambitious people. They were often in “good” jobs and yet they were finding that their day-to-day experience wasn’t that enjoyable. Sometimes, it was because they were in a work environment that was unhealthy or a poor fit for their skill and style, but often it was because of how they were engaging with and experiencing the work. And that does exact a profound cost: when we’re stressed and weary, we’re not getting the most from our days and our organizations aren’t getting the most or the best from us. </p>

<p class="question">There can be a prevailing sense that “powering through your weariness” (as you write) is better, more worthy. Are we so conditioned to equating optimization with energy utilization that we don’t pause to think in terms of outcomes?</p>

<p>You’ve hit the nail on the head. We often think about input rather than output, but as soon as you look at output, it’s very clear that our brains need rest in order to make the best possible decisions in terms of learning and insight. Research shows that the quality of decision-making deteriorates the longer we’ve gone without a break. And it’s not just days that we know will be taxing, such as when we’re heading into a strategy session or client negotiation. Any given day at work has us making a series of tiny decisions. “Do I write an email in this manner or that manner?” “Should I do this task before that task?“ All those small decisions take their toll. The deliberate, conscious part of our brains – the part responsible for sophisticated, considered thinking – needs breaks to refuel. The less rested we are, the less we’re able to make wise decisions. So breaks are not a guilty pleasure. They’re critical to our performance. In fact, studies have also shown that when we step away from a task our brains still remain active - encoding, consolidating, and turning that information into something we can remember and use. So it’s a smart move to take five minutes at the end of a meeting to give our brains time to step away and<br> take stock.</p>

<p class="question">Do you think we’re at a cultural tipping point where businesses are more attuned to the importance of getting the human-side of the balance sheet right?</p>
<p>I do think the rhetoric has changed. In the space of a couple of decades, there’s much less talk of treating employees as cattle. Businesses are less commoditized than they used to be and more focused on agility and service. And that requires a high level of excitement and engagement from your colleagues. Many leaders now know that when people’s brains are on the defensive, when they are feeling at all fearful, they are not able to think at their best. A couple of decades ago, one still sometimes heard of organizations that operated by creating a climate of fear. That’s now largely seen as counterproductive. At the same time, other practices once considered fringe have gained currency. Mindfulness, for instance, has gone from being seen as utterly “woo woo” to being championed by many corporate leaders, largely because there is solid neuro-scientific evidence showing that it enables clear improvements in our analytical ability and manage our emotions. And where once we thought getting these benefits required a heavy commitment, like engaging in an eight-week mindfulness course, new research shows that shorter bursts of mindfulness can create the same benefits when we do it consistently. It’s the same with exercise and sleep. Even small bouts of activity, like a 20-minute walk, and naps, can boost our brain’s attention and engagement and help us thrive. </p>

<p class="question">At various points in the book, you describe opportunities to show warmth. That’s a word one doesn’t often hear stressed in workplace situations. Why is it so important <br>to you?</p>
<p>Our brains are always looking for threats and rewards. And as social creatures, one of the sweetest rewards is a sense of connection. Warmth for me is a catchall phrase for being connected and communicating to others that we see them as fellow human beings. Warmth doesn’t have to mean being huggy. We all have different temperaments. It just means opening up and showing interest. For example, research suggests that a quick way to create rapport is through reciprocal disclosure, with each person being willing to let another in, even if just a little bit, by sharing something real. For a leader, that can be an especially powerful way to build trust. You don’t have to overdo it – after all, most leaders want to shield their employees from difficult things. But many confuse that with the need to look invulnerable, which makes it harder to build deep relationships. The trick is finding the sweet spot. For example, you may be taking tough decisions, but if you can be transparent about how you’re making them and share some of your thought process, those decisions are more likely to be perceived as fair and make you as leader more credible. </p>

<p class="question">You say demeanor is contagious. Why?</p>
<p>Well, the psychology research is clear on this. Emotions spread between people very quickly. So leaders need to be aware that they have a disproportionate impact on the way their employees feel. Back when I was a young manager at McKinsey, I remember arriving at work after a terrible commute. My team was already there waiting for me and I began our session feeling all spluttering and grumpy. One member of my team who was clearly wiser than his years said to me later, “We take our cue from you. When you come in and you’re cranky we know on one level that it’s nothing to do with us, but the truth is it makes us antsy anyway.” Hearing that was transformational. My leadership style changed in a flash. One’s demeanor matters and the more senior you are the more it radiates through an organization.</p>

<p class="question">What can CEOs and other leaders do to create a healthier workplace culture?</p>
<p>All the things in the book! But also, to start an open conversation about it. One of the people I profile in the book is a marketing CEO named Anthony. Anthony had come up through a large agency known for having a really toxic culture of overwork. When it came time to start his new company he thought very hard about ways to create a different environment, one designed to help people’s brains function at their best. He worked to set the right tone through his own actions – visibly taking breaks, single-tasking, and so on. But as the company grew, the pace intensified and things became crazy. Staff were becoming exhausted and the company began to drift away from its original vision. Recognizing that a course correction was needed, Anthony introduced a new process whereby every Monday he gathers his team, has each person name two priorities for the week, then has them talk about which tasks can be redistributed or shared. That weekly reset has helped the company take a collective pause. And it helped Anthony give legitimacy to the importance of managing mental energy as carefully as we manage any other aspect of our professional lives. </p>
